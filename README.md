### Story
In 2056, Pluto, resentful of being banished from the solar system, took over the universe. 
People who once lived there moved to another system. 
Pluto has 5 allied planets that help him develop. 
The main character, Captain Gennady, and his allies have the task of defeating Pluto. 
The first target is the planet Pyron with an army of lizards supporting Pluto. 
This planet must be destroyed.

### Design
Game in pixel style.
The graphic part of the project was made in raster format, so that the game in pixel style really felt pixel.
Pixilart and paint.net technologies were used for this
### Game Code
The structure of the project is different, from a crutch in each node to optimized ideals of the code, and this, in fact, is one of the problems of the project, because for us the Godot engine was something new and we got used to it in these 2 months.
During the development of the game, there were many problems with enemies, with game saves, with the boss.
In general, the main problem of the game was a bunch of canceled ideas, which, fortunately, were implemented in the last days of development.
### Knowledge
You can say that Godot Engine is like Unity, but easier to work with.
I think Godot is a great engine for newbies in the game industry, even better than Roblox Studio.
